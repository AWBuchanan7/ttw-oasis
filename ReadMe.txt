# About

Exclusively for Tale of Two Wastelands!
This is a port of princess_stomper's Oasis Player Home mod﻿, with some additional (small) tweaks to the Oasis area.

The new player home is called 'Solace' and is in the cell 'OasisTrees'. Inside there are two types of cloth sacks: those used as storage, and those that are scripted—they have scripts for "My First Infimary", "My First Lab", and the workbench. The scripted sacks are given unique names such as 'Sack of Tools', etc.

Other Oasis tweaks:
* The shallow surface waters of Oasis are less radioactive to drink (only 3 rads instead of 5)!
* There is also a (crafting) campfire added near some of the beds.

    * For the original Oasis Water Purification mod for FO3 (although I didn't use anything directly from this mod, it did give me the idea to "purify" the Oasis waters, although I opted to leave them slightly irradiated as it seemed unlikely the plantlife would have completely purified it).
